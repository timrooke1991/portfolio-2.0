### A Structured Approach to Problem-Solving

LeetCode has always been something I have been interested in trying, but I have never attempted it in a particularly structured way. Iâ€™ve tackled problems here and there, usually when I needed to prepare for an interview or felt like sharpening my skills. But Iâ€™ve never set a clear goal or followed a dedicated roadmap. Enter Neetcode 150.

The Neetcode 150 challenge is a curated list of problems that cover essential data structures and algorithms. Itâ€™s structured in a way that builds on concepts progressively, ensuring a well-rounded understanding. Since I want to level up my problem-solving ability in a consistent and focused manner, this seemed like the perfect opportunity.

This curated list appealed to me for a number of reasons.

- It brings structure by providing categorised examples (Dynamic programming, Arrays and Hashes, etc) while giving you a flavour of easy, medium and hard challenges that follow the same theme and naturally build on one another.&#x20;

* I've found some Leetcode problems to be really poorly explained or lacking in examples and constraint information, which makes it challenging to even know what the initial problem requirements are, so my hope is this list will filter those problems out.
* The Neetcode 150 is pretty popular online. It was devised by a YouTuber, and a bunch of people have provided videos, blogs and solutions. Therefore, for more challenging problems, it should not be difficult to find content explaining the solution and resolve any issues that I run into.

### The Plan

Iâ€™ll be aiming to complete a few problems per week, depending on complexity and available time. Some problems will be straightforward, others will take hours to crack, and thatâ€™s okay.. The goal is to engage deeply, understand the reasoning behind solutions, and improve both speed and efficiency over time.

To keep myself accountable, Iâ€™ll be sharing regular blog updatesâ€”every couple of weeksâ€”on my experiences, challenges, and insights. Whether itâ€™s an elegant solution Iâ€™m particularly proud of or a frustrating problem that took longer than expected, Iâ€™ll document it all.

### Early Observations

Starting out, Iâ€™ve already noticed a few things:

1. \*\*Solve on paper first, then code\*\* - It is always easier to talk the solution out first, and then code it.
2. **Brute Force First, Optimise Later** â€“ Sometimes, the best approach is to get _something_ working before worrying about efficiency. Many problems start with a naive solution that can later be refined. I have this issue a lot - overthinking, and trying to rush to the best possible solution (often without planning it out ðŸ˜…) and then giving up because itâ€™s way too difficult to hold in my head.
3. **Explaining Solutions is Key** â€“ Writing about solutions, whether in comments, blog posts, or discussions, forces a deeper understanding. Itâ€™s one thing to arrive at an answer, but articulating the _why_ behind it strengthens retention.

### Roadblocks and Challenges

Obviously, not everything will be smooth sailing. Some problems, especially those involving recursion and dynamic programming, have been particularly challenging. Itâ€™s easy to get stuck in a loop of overcomplicating things when a simpler approach exists, or getting tunnel vision towards one particular solution and being unable to step back. Additionally, time constraints mean I canâ€™t always dedicate as much effort as Iâ€™d like to certain problems.

That said, I am aware that the struggle is part of the process. Iâ€™m learning to embrace the difficulty and treat every tough problem as an opportunity to grow. Itâ€™s also a reminder that some days will be more productive than others, and thatâ€™s completely fine.

### Moving Forward

For now, Iâ€™ll continue working through the Neetcode 150 list, focusing on steady progress rather than speed. The aim isnâ€™t just to grind through problems but to understand them and maintain a decent, regular cadence.

Iâ€™ll be sharing updates every couple of weeks, covering the problems Iâ€™ve tackled, the insights Iâ€™ve gained, and any particularly interesting solutions. If youâ€™re also working through Neetcode 150 (or considering it), feel free to follow alongâ€”this should be an interesting journey.
